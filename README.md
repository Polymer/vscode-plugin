# Polymer VSCode plugin

Unlocks all of the power of the [Polymer Analyzer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-analyzer) in your editor.

Features:

 * typeahead completions for imported elements, with documentation
 * typeahead completions for element attributes, with documentation
 * inline errors (squiggle underlines)
 * jump to definition support for custom elements and attributes

## Installing

The plugin will be published on the official marketplace once it's released. For now, download the latest `.vsix` file [directly off github](https://github.com/Polymer/vscode-plugin/releases) and install it with the `code` command on your CLI. e.g.

    code ./polymer-plugin-0.0.1.vsix

You can probably also drag and drop the file or open it directly in vscode in any of a number of other ways.
